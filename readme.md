# Omnifood

This single-page website was created as a final project for an HTML/CSS course, showcasing a fictional company called Omnifood. Omnifood is focused on providing AI-based meals through a subscription service. The project aimed to implement various key features and topics that are commonly used in web development, making it a valuable learning experience for future web projects.

## Key Features

### Hamburger Menu
- A responsive hamburger menu that appears on tablet-sized or smaller screens, providing an intuitive navigation experience for mobile users.

### Smooth Scrolling
- Implemented smooth scrolling functionality when navigation links in the header and footer are clicked, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Intersection Observer
- Utilized Intersection Observer to create subtle animations and a sticky navigation bar. These animations trigger based on viewport rules, such as elements entering or leaving the viewport.

### Functional Form
- Included a functional form for user interaction, such as inquiries or subscription sign-ups, improving user engagement and feedback.

### Full Responsiveness
- Achieved full responsiveness using media queries, making the website adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.

### CSS Layout Techniques
- Employed CSS Grid for larger layouts, enabling flexible and organized page structures.
- Utilized Flexbox for smaller sections, ensuring precise control over the layout and alignment of elements.
- Applied absolute positioning to enhance the positioning of specific elements as needed.

By working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in creating a modern, responsive, and user-friendly website. The skills and techniques learned here can be applied to future web development projects, making this project a valuable step in my journey as a web developer.
